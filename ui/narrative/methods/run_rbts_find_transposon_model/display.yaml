tooltip: |
    If you don't know which transposon model was used when inserting into genome,
    this app finds the best option out of the standard transposon models given
    the reads.

parameters :
    genome_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Target Genome   
        short-hint : |
            The Genome you're checking your reads against to find locations of barcodes.
        long-hint  : |
            This is the genome to whose genes we are going to match barcodes so they can be used to measure the abundance of strains with those genes interrupted.
    fastq_ref_list :
        ui-name : |
            FastQ Mapping Reads
        short-hint : |
            The reads in FASTQ format as a KBase Single End Library Object.
        long-hint  : |
            The Map Tn Seq Program takes a set of Reads objects and maps the embedded barcodes to a location in the genome.
    maxReads :
        ui-name : |
            max Reads per FASTQ
        short-hint : |
            An integer. The total number of reads to parse in the FASTQ input files.
        long-hint : |
    minQuality :
        ui-name : |
            min Quality
        short-hint : |
            An integer. The minimum quality (from Illumina) for all nucleotides for a barcode to pass.
        long-hint : |
